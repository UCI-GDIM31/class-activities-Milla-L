## Devlogs
### W1
"Hello World!"
Today I have learned how to kind of navigate Unity and how to push trough Github. 
I now know how to get all of the homework turned in and I've set myself up to be able to use the class Github. 
Right now I am writing my first Devlog, so that means I know how write these now. 
I plan to commit this first mini project after I'm done writing this. 
I moved the cat from red to green, made it able to move faster and turn faster. 
The cat can move at all because I assigned the movement animation. 

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

### W3
Imagine we need to design a method to perform the following function. 
What would you make the parameters (input) and return type (output) of this method?
Tables 7-13
You’re building a visual novel, and you’re writing a method named GetResponse that gives you a character’s 
text response to a player’s dialogue choice based on the player’s current friendship level with the character 
and a flag that tells you whether or not the player knows the character’s secret.
The inputs would be the friendship level and if the player knows the secret. The outputs would be the diologue choice and if the flag is waived. 
The output would be a sting and a boolean. 

Metaphor:
The classes are like the frames that do nothing by themselves. The Component is like the lenses that tint, perscript, or block out blue light. 
The frames are useless without the lenses, but the lenses need the frames to be held in place. 

The balls get super bright because the color is always multiplied up and doesn't loop or darken at any point.
