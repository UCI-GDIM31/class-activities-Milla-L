## Devlogs
### W1
"Hello World!"
Today I have learned how to kind of navigate Unity and how to push trough Github. 
I now know how to get all of the homework turned in and I've set myself up to be able to use the class Github. 
Right now I am writing my first Devlog, so that means I know how write these now. 
I plan to commit this first mini project after I'm done writing this. 
I moved the cat from red to green, made it able to move faster and turn faster. 
The cat can move at all because I assigned the movement animation. 

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
